## Palindrome Coding Challenge

### Task

Write an application that finds the 3 longest unique palindromes in a supplied string. For the 3 longest 
palindromes, report the palindrome, start index and length, in descending order of length.

### Example Output

Given the input string: `sqrrqabccbatudefggfedvwhijkllkjihxymnnmzpop` , the output should be:

```
Text: hijkllkjih, Index: 23, Length: 10

Text: defggfed, Index: 13, Length: 8

Text: abccba, Index: 5 Length: 6
```

### Deliverables

Your solution must be submitted in Scala.

You should include instructions on how to compile, test and run your code.

You should explain any assumptions that you make.

### Guidance

Your solution should be correct, reliable, and maintainable i.e. production ready.
